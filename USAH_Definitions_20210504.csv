1,Functional Purposes,Cultural heritage and sense of place,"Cities should provide a sense of place and meaningful attachment. Sense of place “echoes the intersections of culture, environment, history, politics and economics, and is impacted by global mobility, and blurred boundaries between natural and built environment” (Adams et al., 2016). Sense of place is therefore closely connected to cultural heritage. Cultural heritage is “a group of resources inherited from the past which people identify, independently of ownership, as a reflection and expression of their constantly evolving values, beliefs, knowledge and traditions” (Council of Europe, 2005. pg. 2). Sense of place and cultural heritage is about the interaction between people and place through time, and a recognition of the intergenerational legacy of the built environment  (Europe, 2005; Russell, Smith and Leverton, 2011). Cities strive to have a strong identity which is felt by both its inhabitants and visitors.","Council of Europe (2005) Council of Europe Framework Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for Society.

1,Functional Purposes,Economic opportunity,"""Agglomeration in cities stimulates trade and allows for increased productivity"" (World Bank, 2017). Citizens are more likely to find jobs suited to their skills in a city because of larger labour markets (Abel and Deitz, 2013). Economic opportunity provides diversity of jobs and economic security, as well as investment in sustainable economic growth.","World Bank (2017) ‘Opportunities and Challenges of Urbanization: Planning for an Unprecedented Future’.

Available at: Do Big Cities Help College Graduates Find Better Jobs? -Liberty Street Economics (newyorkfed.org) (Accessed: 03/05/2021)."
1,Functional Purposes,Globalised connectivity,"Cities provide a globalised flow of information that helps build awareness to the relationship between the local and the global (Knox, 1996).  Cities “contain the economic, cultural, and institutional apparatus that channels national and provincial resources into the global economy and that transmits the impulses of globalisation back to national and provincial centres” (Knox, 1996, pg. 125). They have the potential to have an impact on wider global mechanisms through ‘local’ politics, ""not merely defending the local against the global, but seeking to alter the very mechanisms of the global itself” (Massey, 2004, pg.14). Cities play “an important role in shaping the global economy, culture and society, but they are also shaped by it” (Exenberger and Strobl, 2013).","Knox, P.L. (1996) 'Globalization and the world city hypothesis', Scottish Geographical Magazine, 112(2), pp. 124-126; Massey, D.

(2013) 'Introduction', in  Globalisation and the City: Two Connected Phenomena in Past and Present [online]. Innsbruck: Innsbruck University Press."
1,Functional Purposes,Knowledge transfer and diffusion of innovation,"Cities are a hub for research centres and higher education institutions that “set the cultural, social and intellectual tone of a city “(Beall, 2016). Cities are “not just mere containers for innovative activities but are actively involved in the generation of new ideas... The high level of provision of education, services and leisure activities, combined with high population density and the very high frequency of interactions notably found in cities, favour technological and social innovation” (Commission, 2020). Geographical proximity to knowledge has a strong effect on the number of educated people in a city, as ideas and technology flow out to surrounding businesses (Smith, 2018). This allows cities to ""empower and educate their citizens so they can become members of society capable of engaging in a debate about their own environment"" ( Allwinkle and Cruickshank, 2011, pg. 4)","Commission, E. (2020) The Future of Cities: Cities as Innovation Hubs.

1,Functional Purposes,Physical settlement,"Cities provide adequate housing and accommodation which provides a home for people as well as driving tourism. A physical settlement within a city refers to the “physical spaces and environments in which households are sheltered, and how one shelter related to another”(UNHCR, 2020). The settlement is the physical and social platform ""that establishes the living space of which shelter is but one component” (LeGrand and Malany, 2012, pg. 118). Settlements provide a safe, functional and appropriate living space that support social cohesion (LeGrand and Malany, 2012).","LeGrand, L. and Malany, P.E.

1,Functional Purposes,Pooling of resources,"Cities provide a “collaborative process of bringing together a wide spectrum of actors that work together to co-design and co-produce shared, common goods and services at different scales” (Foster and Iaione, 2017). Co-ordinated efforts and resources of multiple agents allows for more efficient and effective use of resources and public services (Lonsdale et al., 2015). Density allows for economies of scale in collective utilities to provide better services at a lower cost to the individual (EEA, 2015).","Foster, S. and Iaione, C.

(europa.eu) (Accessed 04/05/2021)."
1,Functional Purposes,Safety and security,"“Urban safety refers to the extent to which a city’s inhabitants are able to live, work and participate in urban life without fear of bodily harm and intimidation” (Roberts, 2018, pg. 7). For a city to be safe, it requires security measurements such as law enforcement to respond to crime and reduce feelings of insecurity; emergency response; critical infrastructure that protects physical and mental health; community cohesion and peaceful coexistence by developing a sense of community and trust amongst city residents and working to reduce all forms of segregation within the city; cyber security and data protection (Roberts, 2018). It includes both physical security and perception of safety.","Roberts, J. (2018) Urban Safety Project: Urban Safety and Security in Myanmar. The Asia Foundation."
1,Functional Purposes,Social opportunity and care,"Cities have higher population densities that create the potential to bring people of many different cultural backgrounds together, providing people with the opportunity to experience ‘togetherness’ and meet new people (Knapp, 2008). Cities should drive equal rights and participation of all (World Bank, 2021).  Moreover, a higher population density means that cities offer better access to healthcare and emergency healthcare services (Dunn and Coulton, 2016).","Knapp, C. (2008) Making Multicultural Places.
